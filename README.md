# Linear-Regression on Kaggle ecommerce data
A successful linear regression to keep as code record for future analysis.

Used pandas, matploblib, seaborn and scipy packages.

1. Explore Data Analysis

  A. Used Seaborn to plot columns to find any obvious correlations.
  B. Used SNS to perform a pairplot; showed strong correlation with length of membership and yearly amount spent.

2. Split the data using Scikit-Learn

3. Trained a model using Scikit-Learn

4. Trained a model using Scikit-Learn

5. Created Predictions using model

6. Plotted Predictions

7. Evaluated the model

   A. Errors: Evaluated Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error and Root Mean Squared Error. A lower RMSE indicates a better fit of the model to the data.
   B. Analysis of Residuals: The difference between the predicted data set and the test was minimal showing a strong model. 

Essentially the historical commerce data was used to create a model that could be run on a server or web application to make predcitions for active E-commerce customers and ultimately profits.
